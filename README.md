## üóÇÔ∏è How to Use This Repository

Each `.sql` file can be run independently in a PostgreSQL environment connected to the `cd` schema.

To explore:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `.sql` files in your preferred SQL editor (e.g., pgAdmin, DBeaver, DataGrip).
3. Run the queries against the `cd` sample database.

---

## üí° Notes

- All queries assume the presence of standard tables like `facilities`, `bookings`, and `members` in the `cd` schema.
- Some queries use joins, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and aggregation functions such as `SUM`, `COUNT`, and `MAX`.
